# Playable city: using gaming to crowd source data on vacant land

‘Buy land, they aren’t making it any more’, said famous writer Mark Twain more than a century ago. Land is a limited resource and the pressure on it is enormous, in particular in the world’s largest cities. In London, it has led to a severe housing crisis. Since Britain’s housing market experienced a rush of privatization in 1980s under Margaret Thatcher, the building stock of affordable housing has grown less than the demand and the population. The lack of reliable data is impeding the development of innovative solutions to solve the crisis.

A growing network of citizen activists is trying to bring London’s land ownership and housing crisis to public prominence and counteract real estate behemoths. Rather than providing yet another theory paper, this thesis seeks to support citizen activists by contributing a geospatial game that unlocks a city’s greatest asset: its inhabitants and their collective knowledge. 

Wired magazine sees crowdsourcing as the ‘new pool of cheap labor’ where anyone can contribute to science in his or her free time. At the same time, humanity currently spends around 3 billion hours a week playing online games. Various citizen science projects in geospatial sciences have already tapped into the cognitive power of the masses to collect data or to outsource tasks. However, few have attempted to connect crowdsourcing to the game industry. 

This thesis will introduce a game design methodology for crowd sourcing games. In addition, the online game prototype will be critically evaluated based on two aspects: Firstly, whether a game can create an entertaining experience for players and secondly, whether it can generate scientifically relevant data.
